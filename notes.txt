    - maybe only look at user reports?
-maybe use:
    - product_problem_flag: whether or not a report was about the quality, performance or safety of a device
    - event type: D = Death IN = Injury IL = Injury IJ = Injury M = Malfunction O = Other

2. Simplest scheme for reporting:
    - get number of device problems per device
        - devices > mdrs for that device > recorded device problems
    - get number of patient problems per device
        - devices > mdrs for that device > recorded patient problems

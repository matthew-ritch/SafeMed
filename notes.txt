- detect and group multiple sizes of device? 4Fr vs 5Fr catheters etc.
- how to handle both user and manufacturer submitting reports?
    - maybe only look at user reports?
-maybe use:
    - product_problem_flag: whether or not a report was about the quality, performance or safety of a device
    - event type: D = Death IN = Injury IL = Injury IJ = Injury M = Malfunction O = Other

todo
1. group similar mfr names into one mfr
    - EDWARDS LIFESCIENCE, EDWARDS LIFESCIENCES should be same mfr
2. group similar product names into product families
    - 4.5X14MM CORKSCREW FT, DISPS and 4.5X24MM PERIPHERAL SCREW, NON-LOCKING should be same product family
3. plot safety score charts
    - by product
        - compare to similar products
    - by manufacturer
